# current state

Sarkīs' work is sorted alphabetically by "surname" and the repository contains one TEI XML file for each letter of the Arabic alphabet. Mark-up is still rudimentary and only includes a few author headings (the main reason for this state of affairs is the awfully bad quality of the HTML provided by *shamela.ws* that broke the text into random paragraphs). A human readible HTML web display is available [here](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/oclc_618896732/master/tei/oclc_618896732-div_1.TEIP5.xml).
